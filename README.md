## TASK 
    Create a tool for teachers to author curriculum for a subject.   
    
## Things to implement
    . Row actions - Indent/ Outdent/ Delete
    . Move action - Move nodes around in the curriculum using Drag-Drop or Up-Down arrow.
    . The text in each row should be editable like a text box
    
## Bonus task
    . Load/ Save - Implement 2 buttons - One that “Saves” the JSON data of the curriculum structure created by the user to a file and other that
                   “Loads” the JSON file to recreate the structure in UI. Much like the save/load functionality in a game.
    . Host the working solution

## Note
    . Moving, deleting should preserve parent-child relations between nodes Eg. deleting a node should also delete its children
    . You are free to use any presentational framework (React, Vue, Angular)
    . No need to implement Backend
